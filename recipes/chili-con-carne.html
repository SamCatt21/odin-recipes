        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500g Beef Mince (atleast 10% fat)</li>
            <li>1 finely diced large onion</li>
            <li>3 cloves crushed garlic</li>
            <li>1 finely chopped red chili (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tin chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tin red kidney beans</li>
            <li>500ml beef stock</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato puree</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon mild chile powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon neutral oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a medium sized pot on a high heat and add the oil.</li>
            <li>Once hot, add the beef mince and fry until browned.</li>
            <li>Remove beef from the pot (retaining the fat) and add the onion.</li>
            <li>Fry, stirring regularly, for 5 minutes or until soft and slightly caramelised.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and chile (if using) and fry for 2 minutes or until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Put in all the ground spices and fry for 1 minute stirring constantly to avoid them burning.</li>
            <li>Stir through the tomato paste and cook for 3 minutes to remove the bitterness.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped tomatoes, kidney beans and beef stock and bring to the boil.</li>
            <li>Lower to a simmer and allow to cook for at least 30 minutes (the longer the better). Add extra water if it begins to become dry.</li>
            <li>Season to taste and serve.</li>
        </ol>
